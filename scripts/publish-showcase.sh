# Plain --force, not --force-with-lease, and on purpose. gh-pages is a
# publication, not a history: every single run is meant to replace it
# completely, including a rerun of the very same commit, so there is no
# "someone else's work I might clobber" case here for a lease to protect —
# that is what the workflow's `concurrency` group (see tests.yml) is for,
# by making sure only one publish is ever running at a time. A lease would
# also tie this push's success to the early, best-effort
# `git fetch origin gh-pages` above, which is deliberately allowed to fail
# quietly (a first publication has no previous gh-pages to fetch). A bare
# `--force-with-lease` uses that same fetch as its expected value, so a
# transient network blip on the read side — something this script already
# shrugs off — would turn into a hard failure on the write side instead: a
# legitimate publication rejected for a reason that has nothing to do with
# a race. That trade is worse than the race it would guard against once
# concurrency already serialises publications.
